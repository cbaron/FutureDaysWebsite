        <p>We offer a full range of services, including but not limited to:
        <ul class="services-list">

            <li>Custom software</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
        <p>As the tech industry has exploded, the market has been glutted with countless developers who possess little experience
        and a very narrow set of skills, generally limited to the capabilities of their chosen platform. Most WordPress developers,
        for example, can throw together a theme and some plugins, but if you ask them to implement custom functionality for your site,
        they will likely be at a loss. At Future Days, we understand how the web and applications work at their deepest
        levels. We have built our own framework from the ground up, which we continually refine and optimize. Armed with
        this low level knowledge, we possess the capability to create just about any feature you can imagine. Customization
        is key. As the web becomes ever more streamlined and cookie cutter, we can help you stand out from the pack.</p>

        <p>Versatility is not our only advantage, however. As a small team with limited overhead, we can do the same work
        as larger development firms for less money. And we only charge for new work:  no maintenance fees, and if a bug comes up, we fix
        it without charge, no questions asked. We take full responsibility for the quality of our work.</p>
